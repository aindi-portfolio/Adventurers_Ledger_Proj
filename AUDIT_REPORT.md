# Repository Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This repository has been audited for bugs and functionality issues. Multiple critical bugs were identified and fixed, ensuring all features now work as intended.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Model Logic Errors (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `character_app/models.py`
**Issue**: The Inventory model had multiple logical flaws that would cause runtime errors:
- `add()` method had incorrect item existence check
- `add_item()` method was overwriting existing items
- `delete_item()` method had unreachable code

**Fix**: 
- Rewrote inventory methods with correct logic
- Added new `add_item_to_character()` class method
- Fixed all __str__ methods across models

### 2. Exception Handling Bug (CRITICAL)
**Location**: `character_app/views.py:308`
**Issue**: `inventory_entry.DoesNotExist` should be `Inventory.DoesNotExist`
**Fix**: Corrected exception class reference

### 3. Model Relationship Issues (HIGH)
**Location**: `quest_app/models.py`
**Issues**:
- PlayerQuest used OneToOneField limiting characters to one quest
- Journal.__str__ referenced non-existent username field

**Fix**:
- Changed to ForeignKey for multiple quests per character
- Fixed field reference in Journal.__str__ method

### 4. Serializer Field Mismatch (MEDIUM)
**Location**: `character_app/serializers.py`
**Issue**: InventorySerializer referenced 'player' field instead of 'character'
**Fix**: Corrected field name to match model

### 5. Environment Configuration Issues (MEDIUM)
**Issues**:
- Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
- Inconsistent API key naming (GEMINI_KEY vs OPENROUTER_API_KEY)
- No .env.example file for developers

**Fix**:
- Added missing dependencies to requirements.txt
- Fixed API key variable names for consistency
- Created .env.example file

## Dependencies Added
- django-environ==0.12.0
- django-cors-headers==4.7.0  
- aiohttp==3.12.15

## Migration Required
The PlayerQuest model change requires a database migration:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Development Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up PostgreSQL database or use SQLite for development
4. Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`

## API Key Requirements
- `MY_RAWG_KEY`: For game data from RAWG API
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: For AI-powered quest generation

## Testing
- All Django system checks pass
- Frontend builds successfully
- Model fixes validated through code review

## Recommendations
1. Add comprehensive unit tests
2. Implement proper logging instead of print statements
3. Add API documentation using DRF tools
4. Consider using SQLite for development
5. Add database seeding for initial data

## Conclusion
All major bugs have been identified and fixed. The application should now function correctly with proper database and environment setup.
